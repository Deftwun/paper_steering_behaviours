# paper_steering_behaviours
Playing around with steering behaviours &amp; paperjs

I'm interested in autonomous agents & wanted to toy with steering behaviours. Paperjs also looked cool so I thought I'd try both.
In the end PaperJS has a really cool way of doing vector math, but didn't really seem to fit with what I was trying to accomplish.
I plan on reimplementing this concept & expanding on it with a few different libraries (pixi.js for rendering & victor.js for vector math)
