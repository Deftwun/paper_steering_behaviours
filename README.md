Playing around with steering behaviours &amp; paperjs

I'm interested in autonomous agents & wanted to toy with steering behaviours. Paperjs also looked cool so I thought I'd try both.

In the end PaperJS has a really intuitive way of doing vector math, but the bulk of the library didn't really seem to fit with what I was trying to accomplish.

I plan on reimplementing this concept & expanding on it with a few different libraries (pixi.js for rendering & victor.js for vector math maybe or using phaser)

Also you need to run this on a server due to the way browsers handle cross origin resource requests. Look into http-server on nodejs for a simple solution.
